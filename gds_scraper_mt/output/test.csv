The pellet was discarded; 120 uL of chloroform was added to the supernatant, vigorously shaken, incubated for 2-3 minutes at 20 C and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C. The aqueous phase containing RNA was transferred to a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and washed with an equal volume of pre-chilled 70% ethanol. RNA was then purified using Stratagene‰Ûªs Absolutely RNeasy RT-PCR Miniprep kit. After estimating the yield of total RNA, the solution was concentrated to 1.2 ug/uL RNA using Microcron YM-10 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). RNA integrity was verified by visualization of the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands using the Agilent bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Extracts with evidence of RNA degradation - as indicated by smearing of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA on agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis - were discarded.","Adult, wild-type C57BL/6 breeder mice were purchased at five weeks of age from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). After seven days of acclimatization, timed matings were set up to generate offspring within our colony. Four to six male C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed on weeks 1-10, inclusive. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, decapitated and the whole brain was removed from the skull. The PFC was dissected with a coronal cut approximately 3 mm caudal of the frontal pole (Franklin and Paxinos, 1997), and snap-frozen on dry ice, labeled and stored at -80oC.",,,,

Deconstructing the dynamic transcriptional program of pluripotent stem cells.(Submitter supplied) Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between distinct substates, but the regulatory circuits specifying these states and enabling transitions between them are not well understood. We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly, either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network, increased self-renewal efficiency, and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis.

After 10 minute incubation at room temperature, fixation was terminated by adding 2.5M glycine stock to a final concentration of 125 mM glycine. Cross-linking termination was carried out for 5 minutes at room temperature followed by 15 minutes at 4å¡C. Cells were harvested with silicone scraper and pelleted, washed once with PBS, snap-frozen and stored at -80å¡C until processing.   Cell pellets were thawed for 10 min on ice before use. Nuclei were isolated by resuspending each pellet in 1 mL Cell Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40/Igepal, Protease Inhibitor, PMSF), incubating on ice for 10 min, and spinning to pellet. Nuclei were resuspended in 500 uL Nuclear Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, Protease Inhibitor, PMSF) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After bringing the samples up to volume by the addition of 300 uL IP Dilution Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triston X-100, 0.01% SDS, Protease Inhibitor, PMSF), samples were sonicated for 45 minutes using an Epishear sonicator set at 100% amplitude, with cycles of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off.

After a two hour pre-clear incubation, the beads were pelleted, and 4.5 mL supernatant was removed. 200 uL was reserved for input control, while the remaining supernatant was transferred to agarose beads pre-bound with antibody and rotated overnight at 4å¡C. Bound bead complexes were washed once with 1 mL IP Wash Buffer 1 (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), twice with 1 mL High-Salt Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS), once with IP Wash Buffer 2 (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40/Igepal, 1% Na-deoxycholate), and finally once with 1x TE. Complexes were eluted by twice resuspending bound beads in 110 uL Elution Buffer (100 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS), pelleting the beads after each elution and transferring 100 uL supernatant to a new tube. Finally, 12 uL of 5M NaCl and 20 ug RNase A were added to both 200 uL IP and input samples and incubated at 65 degrees for 1 hour, followed by the addition of 60 ug of Proteinase K and overnight incubation at 65 degrees.

Propidium iodide staining identified dead/damaged cells.To construct single cell libraries from polyA-tailed RNA, we applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (MARS-Seq; Jaitin et al., Science 2014).  This methodology generates paired-end reads where read 1 contains the transcript sequence and read 2 the cell and UMI barcodes. Briefly, single cells were FACS-sorted into 384-well plates, containing lysis buffer and reverse-transcription (RT) primers. The RT primers contained the single cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for subsequent de-multiplexing and correction for amplification biases, respectively.    Full-length RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the SMARTseq2 protocol (Picelli et al., Nat Methods 2013) with minor modifications. Briefly, freshly harvested or cryopreserved (1 week at -80å¼C) single cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing the lysis buffer. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScrpit II (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo-dT30VN, template-switching oligonucleotides and betaine. The cDNA was amplified using the KAPA Hifi Hotstart ReadyMix (Kappa Biosystems), ISPCR primer and 20 cycles of amplification. Following purification with Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckmann Coulter), product size distribution and quantity were assessed on a Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitvity DNA Kit (Agilent). 200 ng of the amplified cDNA was fragmented using Nexteraå¨ XT (Illumina) and amplified with indexed Nexteraå¨ PCR primers. Products were purified twice with Agencourt Ampure XP beads and quantified again using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitvity DNA Kit.","Human cell lines HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells) and K562 (human leukemia cells) were acquired from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ).

Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to identify gene expression patterns operating in Htr3a-GFP+ interneurons during early steps of cortical circuit assembly. more...Organism:	Mus musculusType:		Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingPlatform: GPL13112 223 SamplesFTP download: GEO (TSV) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE90nnn/GSE90860/SRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA356240Series		Accession: GSE90860	ID: 2000908602.

The 1 ml sample suspension was split into two 1.5-ml micro-centrifuge tubes (500 ë_l in each tube). Each sample (500 ë_l) was gently mixed with 0.75 ml of 50% iodixanol to yield 30% iodixanol solution. 50% iodixanol was prepared by adding 0.4 ml diluent (150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, and 120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) to 2 ml of 60% iodixanol (D1556, Sigma). The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min before the supernatant was removed. The nuclei in each tube were incubated on ice for 10 min in 0.5 ml Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (14190144, Life Technologies) containing 2.0% normal goat serum (50062Z, Life Technologies). The nuclei were resuspended and then pooled together (generating ~1 ml in total). For RNA-seq, 3 ë_l of 40 U/ë_l RNase inhibitor was added into the nuclei suspension. The integrity and the number of nuclei were checked under the microscope. 32 ë_l of 2 ng/ë_l anti-NeuN antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (MAB377X, EMD Millipore) was incubated with the nuclei suspension (~1 ml) for 1 h at 4 ‰ãÄ on an end-to-end rotator. The stained samples were sorted using a FACS (BD FACSAria, BD Biosciences) with 50,000 to 100,000 unlabeled nuclei used as non-staining control. Human genomic DNA was purified from GM 12878 cells using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer‰Ûªs protocol and suspended in 50 åµl EB buffer. Mouse genomic DNA was purified using QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen) from nuclei and suspended in 200 åµl AE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 9.0). The eluate was reloaded on the column membrane and spun to maximize DNA yield. Mouse DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation to 20 åµl EB buffer. RNA was extracted from ~10,000 nuclei using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNase treatment step was included following kit instructions to remove gDNA contamination.RRBS library construction. 5 åµl genomic DNA (0.2-6 ng/åµl) was digested by adding 1 åµl of 20 U/åµl MspI enzyme (R0106S, NEB), 2 åµl NEB buffer2 and 12 åµl H2O at 37 ‰ãÄ for 1 h and inactivated at 80 ‰ãÄ for 20 min. The fragment size was examined using 2.5% agarose gel (16550100, Thermo Fisher) in 0.5ÌÑ TBE buffer (15581044, Thermo Fisher). The 3‰Ûª terminal of digested DNA was end-repaired and an extra A which was required by adapter ligation was added on both strands in a single reaction. 1 åµl of 5 U/åµl Klenow exo- enzyme (M0212M, NEB) and 1.1 åµl dNTP mixture (10 mM dATP, 1 mM dGTP and 1 mM dCTP, N0446S, NEB) were added into 20 åµl digested sample. Ten-fold excess of dATP was added to increase A-tailing efficiency. The sample was incubated at 30 ‰ãÄ for 20 min (end-repair), 37 ‰ãÄ for 20 min (A-tailing) and 75 ‰ãÄ for 20 min (enzyme inactivation). The DNA (22.1 åµl) was then purified by phenol‰ÛÒchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA pellet was then resuspended in 17 ë_l EB buffer. 16.4 åµl sample was transferred to a new 200 åµl PCR tube. 1 åµl of 2000 U/åµl T4 ligase (M0202T, NEB), 2 åµl of supplied 10ÌÑ T4 ligase buffer, 0.6 åµl NEXTflex bisulfite-seq barcode (1.6-6 åµM) were mixed with the sample for ligation. The ligation reaction was carried out at 16 ‰ãÄ for 16 h and followed by 65 ‰ãÄ for 10 min for heat inactivation. The heating of the thermal cycler lid was turned off to protect the T4 ligase. Gel-free procedure 17, 28 instead of gel cutting was used for RRBS library construction. Ligated DNA (20 åµl) was purified using AMPure XP beads with bead suspension to sample volumetric ratio of 1.5: 1. The DNA was eluted from Ampure beads by 20 åµl EB buffer. The elute was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and then suspended in 0.7 åµl to facilitate loading into the microfluidic device. The converted DNA was amplifed by PCR (13 cycles for 10 ng, and 16-18 cycles for 1-0.3 ng). After PCR amplification, a double size selection using AMPure XP beads was performed. Large DNA fragments were removed by adding 30 ë_l AMPure bead suspension and incubating for 5 min. The beads that had large DNA bound were discarded and the supernatant was preserved. 30 ë_l AMPure bead suspension were then added into the supernatant and incubated for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and DNA bound to beads was eluted into 7 ë_l EB buffer.mRNA-seq library construction. RNA was extracted from ~100,000 nuclei using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNase treatment was included following manufacturer instructions to remove gDNA contamination. The RNA quality was detected by High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape System (Agilent) to yield RNA integrity number (RIN) > 6. mRNA-seq libraries were prepared using SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Clontech) and Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina) following instructions.","GM12878 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (11875-093, Gibco) plus 15% fetal bovine serum (26140-079, Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (15140-122, Gibco) at 37 ‰ãÄ in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

Embryos at E4.5 were dissected from nascent decidua. The trophectoderm was eliminated from E3.5 and E4.5 by immunosurgery (Solter and Knowles, 1975). Embryos were incubated for 15-30 min in 20% anti mouse anti serum in N2B27 (made in house), rinsed 3 times in N2B27 and transferred to 20% freshly thawed rat serum in N2B27 for 15-30 min. Lysed trophectoderm was removed manually by repeated aspiration using a mouth-controlled finely drawn Pasteur pipette just bigger than the ICM. Isolated ICMs were placed individually in 20 åµL drops of AccutaseTM in a bacteriological dish for at least 5 min until they assumed a blackberry-like appearance. They were transferred to similar sized drops of M2 and aspirated repeatedly using a very finely drawn Pasteur pipette to separate the cells. Cells were immediately placed individually into wells of lysis buffer and frozen. E5.5 embryos were dissected manually and were observed to be early E5.5 cells lacking distinct thickening of the visceral endoderm (pre-AVE migration). The extra embryonic ectoderm was removed using the tip of a pulled Pasteur pipette. The epiblast was separated from overlying visceral endoderm by aspiration, distal end first, with a pulled Pasteur pipette with diameter just bigger than the epiblast. Both epiblast and visceral endoderm were separately disaggregated and plated into wells as described above for ICMs.  E6.5 embryos were visually staged as early streak (Downs and Davies, 1993) and dissected from decidua in PBS and placed into M2 solution to remove extra embryonic tissues. Differences in dissection may contribute to different proportions of primitive streak and epiblast cells obtained at E6.5. The embryonic ectodermal portion of the early streak embryo was dissociated in drops of AccutaseTM at room temperature and upon partial digestion was fully dissociated by repeated aspiration using a very finely drawn, mouth controlled, siliconised glass needle.

Using a quick ligase kit (NEB, Ipswitch, MA), 0.5uM of adaptors were ligated to the cDNA fragments at 12C for 75 minutes, then 80C for 20 minutes and cooled to 4C. These adaptors contain barcodes to facilitate sample multiplexing during sequencing. The adaptor sequence is preceded by four random nucleotides to add diversity to the pooled library. The samples were pooled by combining 5 åµl of each library. After AMPure XP cleanup, one half of the pooled library was run on the Pippin Size Selection Instrument (Sage Sciences, Beverly, MA) to select for 200bp fragments. Library amplification was performed on one half of the Pippin eluate in 1X Phusion GC buffer with 0.2mM dNTP‰Ûªs, 0.1uM forward primer (IDT, Coralville, IA), 0.1 åµM reverse primer, 1 unit of Phusion Hot Start II Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The reaction was run with the following program: 98C for 30s, then 15 cycles of 98C for 10s, 65C for 30s, 72 for 30s, then 72C for 4 minutes and cooled to 4C. The amplified library was cleaned using a 1X volume of AMPure XP beads and QC was run with the Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 kit, followed by concentration determination by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). In order to qualify for sequencing, the library must have a minimum concentration of 4nM and have no trace of low MW (<150bp) primer/dimer product.",,,,,

The first step in the workflow involves purifying the poly-A containing mRNA molecules using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. This is followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. These cDNA fragments then have the addition of a single 'A' base and subsequent ligation of the adapter. The products are then purified and enriched with PCR amplification.  We then quantified the PCR yield by Qubit and pooled samples together to make a single strand DNA circle (ssDNA circle), which gave the final library.",,,,brain,adult

Serial passage (less than 2 passages, or 2 weeks) allowed us to enrich undifferentiated NSCs to high purity (>95% Nestin+/Sox2+). The NSCs were maintained in serum-free B27 medium in presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2/bFGF (Peprotech) and 10 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen). The monolayer cultures were serially passaged every 4-7 days. To avoid the potential non-specific effect induced by prolonged culturing, only NSCs with limited in vitro culturing (less than 3 weeks) were used in the study.

The cigarettes were smoked using a Borgwaldt 20 port rotary smoking machine following International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 3308 (i.e., puff volume of 35 mL, puff duration of 2 s, puff interval of 60 s). The smoke was passed through a 92 mm glass fibre filter disk for particulate matter collection according to the Health Canada official test method. To prepare condensate samples, filter pads were placed in a flask containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (ACS spectrophotometric grade, >99.9%) and shaken on a wrist-action shaker (model 3589, Barnstead International, Melrose Park, IL) for 20 min. Each sample was standardized to a concentration of 30mg TPM per mL of DMSO. For microarray analysis, FE1 cells were propagated from one vial of cryopreserved stock from passage # 19. Cells were exposed to CSC from 3 brands: Brand #1 Full Flavor; Brand #3 ‰ÛÒ Regular; Brand #5 ‰ÛÒ Light King Size. Experiments were performed on 5 replicates per condition (i.e., n=5 per group).

Here, we develop a high-throughput indexed Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (iChIP) method coupled to massively parallel sequencing to systematically map protein-DNA interactions. more...Organism:	Mus musculusType:		Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencingPlatform: GPL15103 117 SamplesFTP download: GEO (BW, TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE36nnn/GSE36099/SRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA155801Series		Accession: GSE36099	ID: 2000360993.

Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 åµl of a master mix (17 åµl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 åµl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 åµl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 åµl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 åµl master mix (17 åµl A-base add mix, 3 åµl Klenow (3‰Ûª->5‰Ûª exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 åµl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 åµl EB).

Finally 5 åµl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 åµl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 åµl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 åµl of a master mix (2 åµl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 åµl dNTP mix, 5 åµl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 åµl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 åµl Nuclease free water) to each well.
