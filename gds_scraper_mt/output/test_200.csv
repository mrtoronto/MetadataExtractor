Considerable effort has focused around the identification of diagnostic biomarkers and the analysis of molecular events.

(Submitter supplied) The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life.  Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population.  Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC.  Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal.  This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

GFP fluorescence was determined directly using a dissecting microscope.  For each GFP positive embryo the bladder was removed at the bladder neck.  The bladder was cut in half and incubated in 20mM EDTA/PBS for 20min at 37C.  It was transferred to fresh DMEM/F12 medium in a petri dish and the urothelium was peeled off the basal lamina, torn and placed in 500uL of 0.25% trypsin, with vigorous vortexing and trituration at 37C for no more than 25min.  After isolation, the samples were kept on ice.  One volume of ice-cold DMEM/F12  plus 10% FBS was added to the sample and spun down at 4C for 5min at 3000 rpm.  The media was removed and the pellet resuspended in fresh ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium.

Briefly,  FACS isolated cells were collected in 200ul of RLT buffer (provided by manufacturer).   The cells were quickly frozen on dry-ice and allowed to thaw on ice.  After the cells were thawed, 50ul of SDS-lysis buffer (50mMTric-HCL pH 7.4/0.05%SDS) was added, the cells were vortexed and an equal volume of 70% ETOH was added.  The cells were voxtexed,  placed on a Qiagen column and centrifuged for 1min at 10,000rpm.  The column was washed by adding 350ul of RW1 and centrifuged for 1min at 10,000rpm.  The extracted RNA was then subject to a 15min on-column DNAse digest following the manufacture's protocol.  After DNase digestion, the column was rinsed with a series of washes including: 350ul of RW1, 500ul RPE and 500ul of 80% ETOH.  After the washes, the column was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5min to ensure the removal of residual ETOH.  The RNA was eluted by adding 16ul of RNAse-free H20 and incubated at room temperature for 2min.  The Qiagen column was placed into a 1.5ml eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1min to collect the RNA.
2ng total RNA was amplified using the Ovation RNA-Seq System v2 (NuGEN #7102).  The libraries were prepared with the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Technologies).  50 ng of cDNA was suspended in Tagment DNA Buffer, and tagmentation (fragmentation and tagging with the adaptors) was performed with the Nextera enzyme (Tagment DNA Enzyme), incubating at 55C for 5 min.  Tagged and fragmented cDNA was purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research).   The libraries were prepared by PCR with Nextera PCR Master Mix, PCR Primer Cocktail and 2 Nextera Indexes (N7XX, and N5XX) according to the following program: one cycle 98C for 30 s (one cycle), 5 cycles of 98C for 10s, 63C for 30s, 72C for 3min.

(Submitter supplied) An in-vivo experiment with UV-B exposure of the skin of nude, male mice, with and without human-derived p53 variants in their genome to investigate the cellular responses upon UV-induced DNA damage. Essentially, 4 replicate mice were used for each level of UV-exposure. For each mouse a biopsy of the skin was sampled 5-6 times at different recovery time points after UV-pulse exposure, which resulted in paired samples. more...

2. Characterization of quiescent adult liver stem cells and downstream lineages [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the liver stem cells (LSCs) holds great promise for new insights into liver diseases and liver regeneration. By employing single-cell RNA-seq technology with weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA), we examined transcriptome features of distinct Krt19 lineage-tracing cell types isolated from Krt19CreERT; Rosa26R-GFP reporter mice, and identified gene expression signatures of quiescent and active adult LSCs, as well as their downstream lineage-restricted progenitors and terminally differentiation hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Much has been learned about transcriptional cascades and networks from large-scale systems analyses of high-throughput data sets. However, analysis methods that optimize statistical power through simultaneous evaluation of thousands of ChIP-seq peaks or differentially expressed genes possess substantial limitations in their ability to uncover mechanistic principles of transcriptional control. By examining nascent transcript RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and binding motif data sets from lipid A-stimulated macrophages with increased attention to the quantitative distribution of signals, we identified unexpected relationships between the in vivo binding properties of inducible transcription factors, motif strength, and transcription. more...

(Submitter supplied) Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B-cell specific enzyme that targets immunoglobulin (Ig) genes to initiate class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Through off-target activity, however, AID has a much broader impact on genomic instability by initiating oncogenic chromosomal translocations and mutations involved in lymphoma development and progression. AID expression is tightly regulated in B cells and its overexpression leads to enhanced genomic instability and lymphoma formation. more...

For each sample, a multiplex RT-PCR assay was first applied to simultaneously amplify 50 AS and/or expression events in a single reaction. The multiplex RT-PCR reaction was carried out in 96-well plates using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer, with the following changes: reactions were performed in a volume of 20 uL with 2 uL of the purified total RNA as input, and a mixture of 50 pairs of primers was added to each reaction with a final concentration of 0.25 uM for each individual forward and reverse primer. Four identical Veriti 96-well Thermal Cyclers (Applied Biosystems) were used with the following conditions: 50°C for 30 minutes, 95°C for 15 minute, 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 seconds, 58°C for 1 minute (slow ramp rate), 72°C for 3 minutes, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes.

To construct single cell libraries from polyA-tailed RNA, we applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (MARS-Seq; Jaitin et al., Science 2014).  This methodology generates paired-end reads where read 1 contains the transcript sequence and read 2 the cell and UMI barcodes. Briefly, single cells were FACS-sorted into 384-well plates, containing lysis buffer and reverse-transcription (RT) primers. The RT primers contained the single cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for subsequent de-multiplexing and correction for amplification biases, respectively.    Full-length RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the SMARTseq2 protocol (Picelli et al., Nat Methods 2013) with minor modifications. Briefly, freshly harvested or cryopreserved (1 week at -80ºC) single cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing the lysis buffer. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScrpit II (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo-dT30VN, template-switching oligonucleotides and betaine. The cDNA was amplified using the KAPA Hifi Hotstart ReadyMix (Kappa Biosystems), ISPCR primer and 20 cycles of amplification. Following purification with Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckmann Coulter), product size distribution and quantity were assessed on a Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitvity DNA Kit (Agilent). 200 ng of the amplified cDNA was fragmented using Nextera® XT (Illumina) and amplified with indexed Nextera® PCR primers. Products were purified twice with Agencourt Ampure XP beads and quantified again using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitvity DNA Kit.","Human cell lines HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells) and K562 (human leukemia cells) were acquired from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ). NIH3T3 (mouse embryo fibroblasts) and MDCK (canine adult kidney cells) were kindly provided by Dr. Manel Esteller (IDIBELL, Spain). HEK293, NIH3T3 and MDCK were maintained in DMEM (10% Fetal Bovine Serum, FBS; 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) at 37ºC (5% CO2). K562 suspension cells were cultured in RPMI (10% FBS; 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) at 37ºC (5% CO2).

Using a Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+-mediated model of colon tumorigenesis, we found that EE vastly improved the survival of tumor-bearing animals, with differential effect on tumor load in male compared to female animals. Analysis of Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+ males showed drastically reduced expression of circulating inflammatory cytokines and induced nuclear hormone receptor signaling, both of which are common in the wound repair process. more...

2. Environmental Enrichment Induces Pericyte and IgA-Dependent Wound Repair and Lifespan Extension in a Colon Tumor Model [Microbiome]
(Submitter supplied) Environmental enrichment (EE) replicates mind-body therapy by providing complex housing to laboratory animals to improve their activity levels, behavior and social interactions. Using a Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+-mediated model of colon tumorigenesis, we found that EE vastly improved the survival of tumor-bearing animals, with differential effect on tumor load in male compared to female animals. Analysis of Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+ males showed drastically reduced expression of circulating inflammatory cytokines and induced nuclear hormone receptor signaling, both of which are common in the wound repair process. more...

Since the microbiome is transmitted from the dam, female C57BL/6J mice were newly purchased from Jackson labs as dams of all animals in the experiment, Further, animals from each genotype were housed together until weaning, then placed within their respective environment, to avoid non-genetic or environmental effects (Moon et al., 2015). Given the possible confounding effects of coprophagia, each cage contained similar numbers of animals from all 4 genotypes: wild-type, Tcf4Het/+ Apc+/+, Tcf4+/+ ApcMin/+, and Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+. Stool was collected from all mice at time of sacrifice from colon during dissection. Genomic DNA was isolated from control and enriched mouse stool samples using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit (QIAGEN, 51504) following manufacturer’s instructions for stool pathogen detection protocol.
Primers were designed to selectively amplify the V1-V3 bacterial genomic 16S rRNA regions and include adapter sequences compatible with the Nextera XT 96 Index Kit by Illumina. The two primer sequences chosen have been published previously as Bosshard forward and 533 reverse (Table S5; (Bosshard et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012).

(Submitter supplied) The proneural transcription factor Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) plays a critical role in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. While previous studies have focused on Ngn3 gene function, little is known about the regulation of Ngn3 protein.  Here we demonstrate that Ngn3 protein undergoes cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-mediated phosphorylation on multiple serine-proline sites. Replacing wild-type protein with a phosphomutant form of Ngn3 increases α-cell generation, the earliest endocrine cell type to be formed in developing pancreas. more...

For shRNA knockdown, ESCs were infected with lentivial shRNA in the presense of 10ug/ml polybrene for 12 hours and then seleted with 2 ug/ml puromycin for 48h before harvest for ChIP-seq or RNA-seq experiments.","RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life technologies). RNAse free DNaseI (Sigma) was used to eliminate DNA contamination and the treated RNA was purified with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
For ChIP, ESCs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. After quenching and cell lysis, chromatin were sonicated using a E220 focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris). 100 µg sheared chromatin, 5 µg antibody, and 50 µl protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA were purified after washing, eluting, and reverse-croslinking and submitted for library preparation.
4C-seq was performed following the protocol published in (van de Werken et al. 2012). In brief, cross-linked chromatin was digested with DpnII, ligated under diluted conditions. Cross links were reversed and DNA was further digested by NlaIII and again ligated under diluted conditions.For each viewpoint approximately 3.2 μg of the 4C-seq library was amplified using 16 individual PCR reactions with inverse primers containing Illumina adaptor sequence. Multiplexed samples were sequenced on the Illumina Nextseq500 system using 75 bp single-end reads according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit complemented with NEXTflex DNA Barcodes from Bioo Scientific. 10 ng of DNA was used as starting material for input and ip samples. Libraries were amplified using 13 cycles on the thermocycler. Post amplification libraries were size selected at 250- 450bp in length using Agencourt AMPure XP beads from Beckman Coulter. Libraries were validated using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Preparation Kit with Ribo-Depletion. Input RNA quality was validated using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. 200ng-1 µg of total RNA was used as starting material.

(Submitter supplied) The interaction between a pathogen and a host is a highly dynamic process in which both agents activate complex programs. Here, we introduce a single-cell RNA-Seq method (scDual-Seq) that simultaneously captures both host and pathogen transcriptomes and use it to study the process of infection of individual mouse macrophages with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Among the infected macrophages, we found three subpopulations and we show evidence for a linear progression through these subpopulations, supporting a model in which these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection.

All 12 ganglia were sequentially digested, first with 1 ml of 40u/ml Papain with NaHCO3 and l-cysteine at 37°C for 13 min, followed by 4mg/ml Collagenase Type 2, 4.7mg/ml Dispase Type 2 at 37 °C for another 13 min. Enzymes were Papain (Worthington #LS003126, Collagenase (Worthington, # LS004174) and Dispase (Roche 04942078001). Ganglia were washed with Tyrode’s buffer (in mM: 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 10 pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.4 (318-323 mOsM) to remove enzymes and transferred into 40μl fresh Tyrode’s solution. Under visual guidance on a stereomicroscope, ganglia were gently triturated 3-5 times each with a 200μm diameter and then a 140μm fire-polished glass pipet. Large debris was removed by gravity filtering the suspension through a ≈35μ cell sieve (Corning 352235) into 1ml Tyrode’s buffer in a 15mm cell culture well. At this stage, the suspension still included significant quantities of axon fragments and glial cells. The cell suspension was gently swirled by hand such that neurons remained concentrated at the center of the well while glial cells and axon fragments dispersed centrifugally to the periphery and could be carefuly withdrawn in 700μl. This manual separation was repeated 8-10 times with 700μl of fresh Tyrode’s buffer at each iteration. Total time for ganglion dissociation and neuronal enrichment was ≈60 min. Cell viability was assessed in an aliquot of each final preparation by trypan blue exclusion on a Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). Two independent cell suspensions (on separate days) that displayed neuronal viability of 93% and 96% respectively (and 50%≤ viability of satellite cells ≤ 12μm in diameter) were used for subsequent steps. The suspension included ≈ 350 cells /μl in a neuron: glia ratio ≥1.5. Each cell suspension was loaded onto a primed Fluidigm C1 System (located in the University of Miami CFAR Core). Capture was on a Fluidigm integrated fluidics circuits (IFC) for large cells (“17-25μm”, Fluidigm 100-5761) exactly according to manufacturer’s instructions. After completion of the run, all capture sites on the chip were examined microscopically and photographed. From a total of 192 sites on two IFCs, we rejected 68 that contained more than one cell or in which captured neurons showed blebs or membrane ruffling. Captured neurons ranged from 19-40μm in diameter.
Synthesis of cDNA libraries and sequencing were performed at the Next-Generation Sequencing Core (NGSC) at the University of Pennsylvania. An Illumina Nextera XT DNA library preparation protocol, modified for single-cell mRNA sequencing of cDNAs acquired on the C1 system was used. Each single cell library was barcoded during synthesis, libraries were pooled (median length before fragmentation was 900bp) and single-end sequenced for a total depth of 250x10^6 reads for the pool, running on a single lane on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (High Output Mode) system. Sequence data were processed through the NGSC’s standard RUM pipeline for genome alignment, junction calling, and feature quantification.

Per biological replicate, 5-6 pairs of limb buds (ca. 3 ×106 cells) were micro dissected in PBS at room temperature (RT). A single cell suspension was obtained by incubating the tissue in 500 µl Trypsin-EDTA 0.05 % (Gibco) at 37°C for 10 minutes shaking at 900 RPM. The cells were resuspended and homogenised using a 0.40 µm cell strainer (Falcon) and diluted in 10% FCS/PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 650 µl 37% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) with a final concentration of 2% and mixed for 10 minutes at room temperature. Fixation was quenched using 1.425 M glycine (Merck) on ice and immediately centrifuged at 260 g for 8 minutes. Supernatant was removed, the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (final concentration of 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M EGTA, and 1x Complete protease inhibitors (Roche)) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Removal of lysis buffer was done by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 minutes at 4°C, followed by removal of supernatant, snap-freezing and storage at -80°C. On the next day, the pellet was resuspended in 520 µl 1x DpnII buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated with 7.4 µl 20% SDS shaking at 900 RPM at 37°C for 1 hour. Next, 75 µl 20% x-100 Triton was added and left shaking at 900 RPM at 37°C for 1 hour. A 15 µl aliquot was taken as a control for undigested chromatin (stored at -20°C). The chromatin was digested using 40 µl 10 U/µl DpnII (Thermo Fisher Scientific) shaking at 900 RPM at 37°C for 6 hours. 40 µl of DpnII was added and samples were incubated overnight shaking at 900 RPM at 37°C. On the third day, 20 µl DpnII was added to the samples shaking 5 more hours at 900 RPM at 37°C. DpnII restriction enzyme was inactivated at 65°C for 25 minutes. A 50 µl aliquot was taken to test digestion efficiency (stored at -20°C). Next, the digested chromatin was diluted and re-ligated in 5.1 ml H2O, 700 µl 10x ligation buffer (Fermentas), 5 µl 30 U/µl T4-ligase (Fermentas), incubated at 16°C for 4 hours and shake manually 3 times. The ligated samples were incubated further 30 minutes at RT. The chimeric chromatin products and test aliquots were de-crosslinked o.n. by adding 30 µl and 5 µl Proteinase K, respectively, and incubated at 65°C overnight. On the fourth day, 30 µl or 5 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase was added to the samples and aliquots, respectively, and incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C. Next, chromatin was precipitated by adding 1 volume phenol-chloroform to the samples and aliquots, vigorously shaking them, followed by centrifugation at 4000 RPM at RT for 15 minutes. The upper phase containing the chromatin was transferred to a new tube. To the aliquots, 100% ethanol was added and the samples were frozen for 30 minutes, centrifuged at 5000 RPM for 45 minutes at 4°C, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 µl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. To the samples, 7 ml H2O, 1 ml 3M NaAc pH 5.6 and 35 ml 100% ethanol was added. The samples were frozen at -20°C for 3 hours. The precipitated chromatin was isolated by centrifugation at 5000 RPM for 45 minutes at 4°C. The chromatin pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, and further centrifuged at 5000 RPM for 15 minutes at 4°C. Finally, the 3C-library chromatin pellet was dried at RT and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. To check the 3C-library, 600ng was loaded on a 1% gel together with the undigested and digested aliquots.
The 3C-library was then sheared using a Covaris sonicator (duty cycle: 10%, intensity: 5, cycles per burst: 200, time: 6 cycles of 60 s each, set mode: frequency sweeping, temperature: 4 to 7 °C).

(Submitter supplied) The molecular basis of signal-dependent transcriptional activation has been extensively studied in macrophage polarization, however our understanding remains limited regarding the molecular determinants of repression. Here we showed that IL-4-activated STAT6 transcription factor is required for the direct transcriptional repression of a large number of genes during mouse alternative macrophage polarization. more...

Individual embryos were then decapitated and heads were placed in fresh EMEM on ice. Embryonic brains were then removed and placed in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without Mg2+ and Ca2+ and manipulated while on ice. The brains were immediately observed under a fluorescent stereomicroscope and EGFP+ brains were selected. EGFP+ regions of interest in the forebrain (hypothalamus) and the midbrain were then dissected and placed in HBSS on ice. This process was repeated for each EGFP+ brain. Brain regions from four EGFP+ mouse pups were pooled together for dissociation.  For P7 brains, pregnant females were sorted into their own cages and checked daily for newly born pups. The morning the pups were born was considered day P0. Once the mice were aged to P7, all the mice from the litter were euthanized and the brains were then quickly dissected and placed in HBSS without Mg2+ and Ca2+ on ice. As before, the brains were then observed under a fluorescent microscope, EGFP+ status for P7 mice was determined, and EGFP+ brains were retained.  For each EGFP+ brain, the entire olfactory bulb was first resected and placed in HBSS on ice. Immediately thereafter, the EGFP+ forebrain and midbrain regions for each brain were resected and also placed in distinct containers of HBSS on ice. Brain regions from five EGFP+ P7 mice were pooled together for dissociation.","Resected brain tissues were dissociated using papain (Papain Dissociation System, Worthington Biochemical Corporation; Cat#: LK003150) following the trehalose-enhanced protocol reported by Saxena, et. al, 201217 with the following modifications: The dissociation was carried out at 37oC in a sterile tissue culture cabinet. During dissociation, all tissues at all timepoints were triturated every 10 minutes using a sterile Pasteur pipette. For E15.5 tissues, this was continued for no more than 40 minutes. For P7, this was continued for up to 1.5 hours or until the tissue appeared to be completely dissociated. Additionally, for P7 tissues, after dissociation but before cell sorting, the cell pellets were passed through a discontinuous density gradient in order to remove cell debris that could impede cell sorting. This gradient was adapted from the Worthington Papain Dissociation System kit. Briefly, after completion of dissociation according to the Saxena protocol, the final cell pellet was resuspended in DNase dilute albumin-inhibitor solution, layered on top of 5 mL of albumin-inhibitor solution, and centrifuged at 70g for 6 minutes. The supernatant was then removed.  For each timepoint-region condition, pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of media without serum comprised of DMEM/F12 without phenol red, 5% trehalose (w/v), 25 μM AP-V, 100 μM kynurenic acid, and 10 μL of 40 U/μl RNase inhibitor (RNasin® Plus RNase Inhibitor, Promega) at room temperature. The resuspended cells were then passed through a 40 uM filter and introduced into a FACS machine (Beckman Coulter MoFlo Cell Sorter or Becton Dickinson FACSJazz). Viable cells were identified via propidium iodide staining, and individual neurons were sorted based on their fluorescence (EGFP+ intensity, See Figure S4B) directly into lysis buffer in individual wells of 96-well plates for single-cell sequencing (2 μL Smart-Seq2 lysis buffer + RNAase inhibitor, 1 μL oligo-dT primer, and 1 μL dNTPs) according to Picelli et al., 201418. Blank wells were used as negative controls for each plate collected. Upon completion of a sort, the plates were briefly spun in a tabletop microcentrifuge and snap-frozen on dry ice. Single cell lysates were subsequently kept at -80°C until cDNA conversion.
Library preparation and amplification of single-cell samples were performed using a modified version of the Smart-Seq2 protocol18. Briefly, 96-well plates of single cell lysates were thawed to 4°C, heated to 72°C for 3 minutes, then immediately placed on ice. Template switching first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed as described above using a 5’-biotinylated TSO oligo. cDNAs were amplified using 20 cycles of KAPA HiFi PCR and 5’-biotinylated ISPCR primer. Amplified cDNA was cleaned with a 1:1 ratio of Ampure XP beads and approximately 200 pg was used for a one-quarter standard sized Nextera XT tagmentation reaction. Tagmented fragments were amplified for 14 cycles and dual indexes were added to each well to uniquely label each library. Concentrations were assessed with Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent (Invitrogen) and samples were diluted to ~2 nM and pooled. Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to a target mean depth of ~8.0 x 105 50bp paired-end fragments per cell at the Hopkins Genetics Research Core Facility.","The Th:EGFP BAC transgenic mice (Tg(Th-EGFP)DJ76Gsat/Mmnc) used in this study were generated by the GENSAT Project and were purchased through the Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers (MMRRC) Repository. Mice were maintained on a Swiss Webster (SW) background with female SW mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories. The Tg(Th-EGFP)DJ76Gsat/Mmnc line was primarily maintained through matings between Th:EGFP positive, hemizygous male mice and wild-type SW females (dams). Timed matings for cell isolation were similarly established between hemizygous male mice and wild-type SW females. The observation of a vaginal plug was defined as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).

In brief, a total of ~50,000 cells were washed once with 50 μl of cold PBS and resuspended in 50μl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630). The suspension of nuclei was then centrifuged for 10 min at 500g at 4°C, followed by the addition of 50 μl transposition reaction mix (25 μl TD buffer, 2.5 μl Tn5 transposase and 22.5 μl nuclease-free H2O) of Nextera DNA library Preparation Kit (96 samples) (FC-121-1031, Illumina). Samples were then PCR amplified and incubated at 37°C for 30min. DNA was isolated using a MinElute Kit (Qiagen). ATAC-seq libraries were first subjected to 5 cycles of pre-amplification. To determine the suitable number of cycles required for the second round of PCR the library was assessed by quantitative PCR as described (Buenrostro et al., 2015), and the library was then PCR amplified for the appropriate number of cycles. Libraries were purified with a Qiaquick PCR (Qiagen) column and were quantified using a KAPA Library Quantification kit (KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis. Finally, the ATAC library was sequenced on a NextSeq 500 using a NextSeq 500 High Output Kit v2 (150 cycles) (FC-404-2002, Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The donor plasmid for homologous recombination including homology arms and neo cassette was described previously (Pan et al., 2016). In brief, 5x 106 H9 ESCs were mixed with plasmid cocktail and electroporated. After electroporation, cells were plated on G418-resistant MEF feeders. Two days later, cells were treated with 50 ug/ml G418 (Gibco) for screening. After 2 weeks of selection, G418-resistant clones were manually picked to 96-well plates and expanded for genotyping. Gene-targeted clones were determined by genomic PCR. Lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 mediated FOXD1 knockdown:Lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing was performed as previously described (Sanjana et al., 2014; Shalem et al., 2014). Briefly, the single guide RNA targeting FOXD1 was cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene#52961) which contained two expression cassettes, hSpCas9 and the chimeric guide RNA.

After thoroughly mincing the tissue/organ using a sterile scalpel (Feather), the tissue/organ was placed in gentleMACS C Tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) containing 1.5ml DMEM (Life Technologies) with 0.1mg/ml Liberase TL (Roche). The tissue was then dissociated using the D program of the gentleMacs dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by 30 min incubation at 37°C.
FACS-seq protocol: Single cell sorting was performed at the Siteman Flow Cytometry Core (Washington University) using an iCyt Synergy sorter (Sony). Single cells were sorted directly into 10x lysis buffer (Clontech) in 96well PCR plates. Data were analyzed by using Flow Jo software (Version 9.6.2, Tree Star Inc).  96-well plates with single cell in each well were sealed and sent to the sequencing core at Washington University in St Louis (Genome Technology Access Center, GTAC). RNA from individual wells were processed with the Clonetech Smarter system and ligated with unique barcodes. Each plate was then pooled into one library and the resulting pools were then ligated to adapters containing unique 7bp index sequences so that samples originating from a single plate can be identified by Illumina conventional indexing strategies and each individual well is defined by barcoades sequenced on the first read of a paired end read pair. All plates were pooled into a single library and subjected to Illumina sequencing (HiSeq2500 2x50bp).

(Submitter supplied) Intermittent fasting is previously reported to exhibit neuroprotection against experimental ischemic stroke. However, the detailed understanding of protection mechanisms are lacking. By observing the overall transcriptomic changes in each timepoint of ischemic stroke would benefit the understanding of underlying active pathways and mechanisms. Here, we conduct experimental MCAO ischemic stroke on mice exposed to different daily intermittent fasting method to compare not only among the ischemic stroke timepoints but also the efficacy of different intermittent fasting interventions. more...

Cells were then sorted for DAPI-negative, CD34+ and CD34-negative cells using BD Influx. For the species mixing experiment, human MPL expressing Ba/F3 and UT-7 cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction, after which they were subjected to infection with CALR  variant lentiviral supernatants. Wildtype UT7 cells and mutant Ba/F3 cells were mixed in equal proportions.
The standard 10x Genomics Chromium v.2 protocol was carried out according to manufacturer’s recommendations (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) until after emulsion breakage and recovery of first strand cDNA. If the targeted gene of interest, e.g. SF3B1, was not robustly detected by the standard 10x procedure (i.e. if <60% of the expected cells showed expression) based on a priori knowledge in a similar dataset, a gene-specific primer was spiked into 10x primer mix at 1% of the concentration of the cDNA amplification primers for the initial cDNA PCR step. Then, during the amplification step, the 10x cDNA library underwent an extra cycle of PCR beyond the manufacturer’s recommended number of cycles. After cleanup with SPRIselect, a small portion of the cDNA library, 3 µL (~10% of total) was aliquoted for targeted genotyping, and the remaining cDNA underwent the standard 10x protocol. The cDNA set aside for GoT was amplified for 3 to 4 additional cycles using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPABiosystems) and 10x primer mix to provide sufficient material for the enrichment step. After clean-up, locus-specific reverse primers and the generic forward SI-PCR were used to amplify the site of interest of the cDNA template (Supplementary Table 3) using ~10 PCR cycles. The locus-specific reverse primers contain a partial Illumina read 2 handle, a stagger to increase the complexity of the library for optimal sequencing and a gene specific region to allow specific priming. The SI-PCR oligo (10x) anneals to the partial Illumina read 1 sequence at the 3’ end of the molecule, preserving the cell barcode (CB) and UMI. After the initial amplification and SPRI purification to remove unincorporated primers, a second PCR was performed with a generic forward PCR primer (P5_generic) to retain the CB and UMI together with an RPI-x primer (Illumina) to complete the P7 end of the library and add a sample index. The targeted amplicon library was subsequently spiked into the remainder of the 10x library to be sequenced together on a HiSeq 2500 or sequenced separately on MiSeq with v3 chemistry (Illumina).

(Submitter supplied) We screened RNAseq results from RAW 264.7 macrophages for previous empirically-defined M2 genes in the whole transcriptome that followed the Arg1 pattern of up-regulation by β-adrenergic-signaling with inhibition by Cebpb gene knockdown. We also screened RAW 264.7 macrophages for empirically-defined M1 genes that exhibited the orthogonal pattern of Arg1 regulation (i.e., down-regulation by β-adrenergic signaling, with rescue of this effect by Cebpb knockdown).

The resulting regulatory macrophages (M regs) expressed markers distinguishing them from M0-, M1-, and M2-polarised macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs. M regs completely suppressed polyclonal T cell proliferation through an inducibile nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent mechanism. Additionally, M regs were found to eliminate cocultured T cells in an allospecific fashion. more...

In embryonic stem cell, LIN28A specifically binds to let-7 precursors to suppress biogenesis of the let-7 microRNA family. In addition, Lin28 was reported to bind several mRNAs such as Oct4, cyclin A/B and histone H2A to activate their translation. more...
