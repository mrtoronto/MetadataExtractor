In this study, we show that murine lung and gut lamina propria CD11b+ DC populations are comprised of two subsets: FLT3- and IRF4-dependent CD24+CD64- DCs and contaminating CSF-1R-dependent CD24-CD64+ macrophages. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by array\nPlatform: GPL6887 6 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE46nnn/GSE46680/\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE46680\tID: 200046680\n\n2.

Individual embryos were then decapitated and heads were placed in fresh EMEM on ice. Embryonic brains were then removed and placed in Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without Mg2+ and Ca2+ and manipulated while on ice. The brains were immediately observed under a fluorescent stereomicroscope and EGFP+ brains were selected. EGFP+ regions of interest in the forebrain (hypothalamus) and the midbrain were then dissected and placed in HBSS on ice. This process was repeated for each EGFP+ brain. Brain regions from four EGFP+ mouse pups were pooled together for dissociation.  For P7 brains, pregnant females were sorted into their own cages and checked daily for newly born pups. The morning the pups were born was considered day P0. Once the mice were aged to P7, all the mice from the litter were euthanized and the brains were then quickly dissected and placed in HBSS without Mg2+ and Ca2+ on ice. As before, the brains were then observed under a fluorescent microscope, EGFP+ status for P7 mice was determined, and EGFP+ brains were retained.  For each EGFP+ brain, the entire olfactory bulb was first resected and placed in HBSS on ice. Immediately thereafter, the EGFP+ forebrain and midbrain regions for each brain were resected and also placed in distinct containers of HBSS on ice. Brain regions from five EGFP+ P7 mice were pooled together for dissociation.",
        "extract_protocol": "Resected brain tissues were dissociated using papain (Papain Dissociation System, Worthington Biochemical Corporation; Cat#: LK003150) following the trehalose-enhanced protocol reported by Saxena, et. al, 201217 with the following modifications: The dissociation was carried out at 37oC in a sterile tissue culture cabinet. During dissociation, all tissues at all timepoints were triturated every 10 minutes using a sterile Pasteur pipette. For E15.5 tissues, this was continued for no more than 40 minutes. For P7, this was continued for up to 1.5 hours or until the tissue appeared to be completely dissociated. Additionally, for P7 tissues, after dissociation but before cell sorting, the cell pellets were passed through a discontinuous density gradient in order to remove cell debris that could impede cell sorting. This gradient was adapted from the Worthington Papain Dissociation System kit. Briefly, after completion of dissociation according to the Saxena protocol, the final cell pellet was resuspended in DNase dilute albumin-inhibitor solution, layered on top of 5 mL of albumin-inhibitor solution, and centrifuged at 70g for 6 minutes. The supernatant was then removed.  For each timepoint-region condition, pellets were resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of media without serum comprised of DMEM/F12 without phenol red, 5% trehalose (w/v), 25 \u03bcM AP-V, 100 \u03bcM kynurenic acid, and 10 \u03bcL of 40 U/\u03bcl RNase inhibitor (RNasin\u00ae Plus RNase Inhibitor, Promega) at room temperature. The resuspended cells were then passed through a 40 uM filter and introduced into a FACS machine (Beckman Coulter MoFlo Cell Sorter or Becton Dickinson FACSJazz). Viable cells were identified via propidium iodide staining, and individual neurons were sorted based on their fluorescence (EGFP+ intensity, See Figure S4B) directly into lysis buffer in individual wells of 96-well plates for single-cell sequencing (2 \u03bcL Smart-Seq2 lysis buffer + RNAase inhibitor, 1 \u03bcL oligo-dT primer, and 1 \u03bcL dNTPs) according to Picelli et al., 201418. Blank wells were used as negative controls for each plate collected. Upon completion of a sort, the plates were briefly spun in a tabletop microcentrifuge and snap-frozen on dry ice. Single cell lysates were subsequently kept at -80\u00b0C until cDNA conversion.\nLibrary preparation and amplification of single-cell samples were performed using a modified version of the Smart-Seq2 protocol18. Briefly, 96-well plates of single cell lysates were thawed to 4\u00b0C, heated to 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes, then immediately placed on ice. Template switching first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed as described above using a 5\u2019-biotinylated TSO oligo. cDNAs were amplified using 20 cycles of KAPA HiFi PCR and 5\u2019-biotinylated ISPCR primer. Amplified cDNA was cleaned with a 1:1 ratio of Ampure XP beads and approximately 200 pg was used for a one-quarter standard sized Nextera XT tagmentation reaction. Tagmented fragments were amplified for 14 cycles and dual indexes were added to each well to uniquely label each library. Concentrations were assessed with Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent (Invitrogen) and samples were diluted to ~2 nM and pooled. Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to a target mean depth of ~8.0 x 105 50bp paired-end fragments per cell at the Hopkins Genetics Research Core Facility.",

The Tg(Th-EGFP)DJ76Gsat/Mmnc line was primarily maintained through matings between Th:EGFP positive, hemizygous male mice and wild-type SW females (dams). Timed matings for cell isolation were similarly established between hemizygous male mice and wild-type SW females. The observation of a vaginal plug was defined as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). All work involving mice (husbandry, colony maintenance and euthanasia) were reviewed and pre-approved by the institutional care and use committee.",

A comprehensive map coupling histone modifications with gene regulation in adult dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons [scRNA-Seq]\n(Submitter supplied) The adult brain is composed of hundreds of different neuronal subtypes, which retain their differentiated traits and identity throughout the lifespan of the organism. Nevertheless, in part due to technical limitations, the mechanisms governing this stability are not fully understood. Here, using a strategy that allows for ChIP-seq combined with RNA-seq in sparse neuronal populations in vivo, we present, to our knowledge, the first comparative analysis of permissive and repressive histone modifications in adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons, raphe nuclei serotonergic neurons and embryonic neural progenitors. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL13112 98 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (CSV) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE107nnn/GSE107740/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA421260\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE107740\tID: 200107740\n\n2.

The multiplex RT-PCR reaction was carried out in 96-well plates using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer, with the following changes: reactions were performed in a volume of 20 uL with 2 uL of the purified total RNA as input, and a mixture of 50 pairs of primers was added to each reaction with a final concentration of 0.25 uM for each individual forward and reverse primer. Four identical Veriti 96-well Thermal Cyclers (Applied Biosystems) were used with the following conditions: 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 15 minute, 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 40 seconds, 58\u00b0C for 1 minute (slow ramp rate), 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes, and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Two sets of barcodes were incorporated into forward and reverse primers, respectively, after the universal adaptors and added to the amplicons in the second PCR reaction to allow demultiplexing all reads that were derived from a particular treatment. Primers sequences were: forward primer, AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNNNNACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT (N denotes i5 barcode); reverse primer, CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNNNGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT (N denotes i7 primer). The second PCR was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific), as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For each 20 uL of reaction, 1 uL of the multiplex RT-PCR reaction products was used as templates. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 98\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 15 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 seconds, 65\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes.

Analyzing 818 ligand-receptor interaction pairs within and between cell lineages, we identify broadly interacting cells, including AT2, ILC and basophils. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL19057 180 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE119nnn/GSE119228/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA488550\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE119228\tID: 200119228",

Rod-shaped live cardiomyocytes (viability of cardiomyocytes was over 80% for all time points) were immediately collected from two mice at each time point with a 0.2\u20132-\u00b5l pipette (sample volume, 0.5 \u00b5l) and incubated in lysis buffer.\nSingle-cell cDNA libraries were generated using the Smart-seq2 protocol and the efficiency of reverse transcription was assessed by examining the Ct (Cycle threshold) values from real-time quantitative RT-PCR of control genes (Tnnt2, Cox6a2) using a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) and by examining the distribution of the lengths of cDNA fragments using a LabChip GX (Perkin Elmer) and/or TapeStation 2200 (Agilent Technologies). The following primer sets were used for real-time quantitative RT-PCR: Tnnt2 mRNA forward, TCCTGGCAGA GAGGAGGAAG; Tnnt2 mRNA reverse, TGCAGGTCGA ACTTCTCAGC; Cox6a2 mRNA forward, CGTAGCCCTC TGCTCCCTTA; Cox6a2 mRNA reverse, GGATGCGGAG GTGGTGATAC.

A Stringent Systems Approach Uncovers Gene-Specific Mechanisms Regulating Inflammation [ATAC-seq]\n(Submitter supplied) Much has been learned about transcriptional cascades and networks from large-scale systems analyses of high-throughput data sets. However, analysis methods that optimize statistical power through simultaneous evaluation of thousands of ChIP-seq peaks or differentially expressed genes possess substantial limitations in their ability to uncover mechanistic principles of transcriptional control. By examining nascent transcript RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and binding motif data sets from lipid A-stimulated macrophages with increased attention to the quantitative distribution of signals, we identified unexpected relationships between the in vivo binding properties of inducible transcription factors, motif strength, and transcription. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL13112 8 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (BEDGRAPH) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE74nnn/GSE74191/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA299297\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE74191\tID: 200074191\n\n2.

Single cells were sorted directly into 10x lysis buffer (Clontech) in 96well PCR plates. Data were analyzed by using Flow Jo software (Version 9.6.2, Tree Star Inc).  96-well plates with single cell in each well were sealed and sent to the sequencing core at Washington University in St Louis (Genome Technology Access Center, GTAC). RNA from individual wells were processed with the Clonetech Smarter system and ligated with unique barcodes. Each plate was then pooled into one library and the resulting pools were then ligated to adapters containing unique 7bp index sequences so that samples originating from a single plate can be identified by Illumina conventional indexing strategies and each individual well is defined by barcoades sequenced on the first read of a paired end read pair. All plates were pooled into a single library and subjected to Illumina sequencing (HiSeq2500 2x50bp).\nRNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard FACS-seq procedure",

Per biological replicate, 5-6 pairs of limb buds (ca. 3 \u00d7106 cells) were micro dissected in PBS at room temperature (RT). A single cell suspension was obtained by incubating the tissue in 500 \u00b5l Trypsin-EDTA 0.05 % (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes shaking at 900 RPM. The cells were resuspended and homogenised using a 0.40 \u00b5m cell strainer (Falcon) and diluted in 10% FCS/PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 650 \u00b5l 37% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) with a final concentration of 2% and mixed for 10 minutes at room temperature. Fixation was quenched using 1.425 M glycine (Merck) on ice and immediately centrifuged at 260 g for 8 minutes. Supernatant was removed, the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (final concentration of 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M EGTA, and 1x Complete protease inhibitors (Roche)) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Removal of lysis buffer was done by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C, followed by removal of supernatant, snap-freezing and storage at -80\u00b0C. On the next day, the pellet was resuspended in 520 \u00b5l 1x DpnII buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated with 7.4 \u00b5l 20% SDS shaking at 900 RPM at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Next, 75 \u00b5l 20% x-100 Triton was added and left shaking at 900 RPM at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. A 15 \u00b5l aliquot was taken as a control for undigested chromatin (stored at -20\u00b0C). The chromatin was digested using 40 \u00b5l 10 U/\u00b5l DpnII (Thermo Fisher Scientific) shaking at 900 RPM at 37\u00b0C for 6 hours. 40 \u00b5l of DpnII was added and samples were incubated overnight shaking at 900 RPM at 37\u00b0C. On the third day, 20 \u00b5l DpnII was added to the samples shaking 5 more hours at 900 RPM at 37\u00b0C. DpnII restriction enzyme was inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 25 minutes. A 50 \u00b5l aliquot was taken to test digestion efficiency (stored at -20\u00b0C). Next, the digested chromatin was diluted and re-ligated in 5.1 ml H2O, 700 \u00b5l 10x ligation buffer (Fermentas), 5 \u00b5l 30 U/\u00b5l T4-ligase (Fermentas), incubated at 16\u00b0C for 4 hours and shake manually 3 times. The ligated samples were incubated further 30 minutes at RT. The chimeric chromatin products and test aliquots were de-crosslinked o.n. by adding 30 \u00b5l and 5 \u00b5l Proteinase K, respectively, and incubated at 65\u00b0C overnight. On the fourth day, 30 \u00b5l or 5 \u00b5l of 10 mg/ml RNase was added to the samples and aliquots, respectively, and incubated for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Next, chromatin was precipitated by adding 1 volume phenol-chloroform to the samples and aliquots, vigorously shaking them, followed by centrifugation at 4000 RPM at RT for 15 minutes. The upper phase containing the chromatin was transferred to a new tube. To the aliquots, 100% ethanol was added and the samples were frozen for 30 minutes, centrifuged at 5000 RPM for 45 minutes at 4\u00b0C, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 \u00b5l 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. To the samples, 7 ml H2O, 1 ml 3M NaAc pH 5.6 and 35 ml 100% ethanol was added. The samples were frozen at -20\u00b0C for 3 hours. The precipitated chromatin was isolated by centrifugation at 5000 RPM for 45 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The chromatin pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, and further centrifuged at 5000 RPM for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Finally, the 3C-library chromatin pellet was dried at RT and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. To check the 3C-library, 600ng was loaded on a 1% gel together with the undigested and digested aliquots.\nThe 3C-library was then sheared using a Covaris sonicator (duty cycle: 10%, intensity: 5, cycles per burst: 200, time: 6 cycles of 60 s each, set mode: frequency sweeping, temperature: 4 to 7 \u00b0C). Adaptors were added to the sheared DNA and amplified according to Agilent instructions for Illumina sequencing. The library was hybridized to the custom-designed sure-select beads and indexed for sequencing (50 to 100 bp paired-end) following Agilent instructions.",

Within ESCs translation level and mRNA stability are positively correlated. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL21103 18 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE112nnn/GSE112763/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA448915\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE112763\tID: 200112763\n\n3.

Although the underlying disease mechanisms remain unknown, glial cells have been implicated in ALS disease progression. Here we examine the effects of glial cell/motor neuron interactions on gene expression, using the hSOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. We detect striking cell autonomous and non-autonomous changes in gene expression in co-cultured motor neurons and glia, revealing that the two cell types profoundly affect each other. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatforms: GPL9250 GPL11002 59 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE43nnn/GSE43879/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA187985\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE43879\tID: 200043879\n\n2.

Analysis of Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+ males showed drastically reduced expression of circulating inflammatory cytokines and induced nuclear hormone receptor signaling, both of which are common in the wound repair process. more...\nOrganism:\tmouse gut metagenome\nType:\t\tOther\nPlatform: GPL22735 41 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE90nnn/GSE90801/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA355991\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE90801\tID: 200090801\n\n3.

Since the microbiome is transmitted from the dam, female C57BL/6J mice were newly purchased from Jackson labs as dams of all animals in the experiment, Further, animals from each genotype were housed together until weaning, then placed within their respective environment, to avoid non-genetic or environmental effects (Moon et al., 2015). Given the possible confounding effects of coprophagia, each cage contained similar numbers of animals from all 4 genotypes: wild-type, Tcf4Het/+ Apc+/+, Tcf4+/+ ApcMin/+, and Tcf4Het/+ ApcMin/+. Stool was collected from all mice at time of sacrifice from colon during dissection. Genomic DNA was isolated from control and enriched mouse stool samples using QIAamp DNA Stool Minikit (QIAGEN, 51504) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions for stool pathogen detection protocol.\nPrimers were designed to selectively amplify the V1-V3 bacterial genomic 16S rRNA regions and include adapter sequences compatible with the Nextera XT 96 Index Kit by Illumina. The two primer sequences chosen have been published previously as Bosshard forward and 533 reverse (Table S5; (Bosshard et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012). Samples were amplified using 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems, KK2601) with primers at a final working concentration of 1 \u00b5M, purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, A63880), and indexed using Nextera XT 96 Index Kit (Illumina, FC-131-1002). Final samples were re-purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, A63880), resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, and pooled at a final concentration of 4 nM.",

Polyadenylated RNA was further enriched from total RNA by using Dynabeads\u00ae mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen).\nFor Ribo-Seq\uff1a10% clarified lysate was saved as INPUT and the rest lysate was separated through a 5ml 10%-50% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 2 h at 28,000 r.p.m. Fractions were collected separately and analyzed by Qubit\u2122 RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The fractions corresponding to ribosomes were combined and concentrated on Amicon-Ultra 100K columns (Millipore). 2 A260 units of ribosome fractions were digested with 60U RNase I (Ambion) at room temperature for 30 min. RNA was extracted by RNA Clean&Concentrate (Zymo) and ribosomal RNA were deleted prior to size selection. RNA fragments (26-32nt) were isolated by 15% denaturing Urea-PAGE gel. RNA was eluted from gel in elution buffer (300 mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 1 mM EDTA) followed by phenol-chloroform extract and ethanol precipitation. RNA fragments were dephosphorylated and prepared into libraries by SMARTer\u00ae smRNA-Seq Kit (Clontech); For m6A-Seq: RNA samples were fragmented into ~100-nucleotide-long fragments with sonication. Fragmented RNA (100ng mRNA or 5\u00b5g total RNA) was performed m6A-IP following EpiMark N6-methyladenosine enrichment kit (NEB E1610S) protocol.

Following addition of glycine (0.25 M final concentration) to quench the crosslinking reaction and washing, the pellet was frozen until a sufficient number of pituitaries could be collected. Pellets corresponding to 12 pituitaries were resuspended in 1200 \u00b5l TE buffer containing protease inhibitors and 1 % SDS, and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp. Three independent pools, corresponding to biological replicates, were used. ChIP was performed as described by Spencer et coll.  (Spencer, Sun, Li, & Davie, 2003) using polyclonal antibodies directed against POU1F1 (X7, from Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Following elution of the DNA-protein complexes from protein A-Sepharose, decomplexation by heating overnight at 65\u00b0C, and digestion by RNAse A and proteinase K, DNA was purified using Nucleospin extract II (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) and amplified by ligation-mediated PCR according to the protocol given by NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA).",

After the cells were thawed, 50ul of SDS-lysis buffer (50mMTric-HCL pH 7.4/0.05%SDS) was added, the cells were vortexed and an equal volume of 70% ETOH was added.  The cells were voxtexed,  placed on a Qiagen column and centrifuged for 1min at 10,000rpm.  The column was washed by adding 350ul of RW1 and centrifuged for 1min at 10,000rpm.  The extracted RNA was then subject to a 15min on-column DNAse digest following the manufacture's protocol.  After DNase digestion, the column was rinsed with a series of washes including: 350ul of RW1, 500ul RPE and 500ul of 80% ETOH.  After the washes, the column was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5min to ensure the removal of residual ETOH.  The RNA was eluted by adding 16ul of RNAse-free H20 and incubated at room temperature for 2min.  The Qiagen column was placed into a 1.5ml eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1min to collect the RNA.\n2ng total RNA was amplified using the Ovation RNA-Seq System v2 (NuGEN #7102).  The libraries were prepared with the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina Technologies).  50 ng of cDNA was suspended in Tagment DNA Buffer, and tagmentation (fragmentation and tagging with the adaptors) was performed with the Nextera enzyme (Tagment DNA Enzyme), incubating at 55C for 5 min.  Tagged and fragmented cDNA was purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research).   The libraries were prepared by PCR with Nextera PCR Master Mix, PCR Primer Cocktail and 2 Nextera Indexes (N7XX, and N5XX) according to the following program: one cycle 98C for 30 s (one cycle), 5 cycles of 98C for 10s, 63C for 30s, 72C for 3min.

ChIP-Seq analysis of Histone H3 acetylation (K27) changes in response to vasopressin in mouse renal collecting duct mpkCCD cells\n(Submitter supplied) In mammals, the peptide hormone vasopressin controls renal water excretion, largely through regulation of the molecular water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal collecting duct. Regulatory mechanisms of AQP2 show:  1) short-term regulation by membrane trafficking; and 2) long-term regulation involving vasopressin-induced changes in the abundance of the aquaporin-2 protein. Vasopressin activates a G protein-coupled receptor (V2R) increasing cyclic AMP  and activating protein kinase PKA. more...\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tGenome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL13112 8 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (BEDGRAPH, TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE95nnn/GSE95007/\nSRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA375712\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE95007\tID: 200095007\n\n3.

At that point, the complet medium was changed to serum- and hormone-free medium, and cells were maintained for 24 hr. Cells were incubated with the V2 receptor-selective vasopressin analog dDAVP (0.1 nM) or its vehicle (n=2) and harvested after 24 hr.",
        "extract_protocol": "Shearing of chromatin was carried out by the manufacturer's protocol of truChIP kit (PN 520075, Covaris, Woburn, Massachusetts). All Covaris buffers were provided in kit. Confluent monolayers mpkCCD cells cultured on 100 mm permeable supports of transwell system were treated with dDAVP (0.1 nM) or vehicle for 24 h and then washed in ice-cold PBS followed by cross-linking in 1.11% formaldehyde in Covaris Fixing Buffer (5.5 ml) for 5 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of 1X Covaris Quenching Buffer with rocking. The buffer solution was aspirated and ice-cold PBS was added to each plate. Cells were scraped, spun down (200xg, 5 min), and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 1X Covaris Lysis Buffer for 10 min at 4\u00b0C with rocking.  Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 1,700xg for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Nuclear pellets was resuspended in 1 ml of 1X Covaris Wash Buffer and incubated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C with rocking. Samples were spun at 1,700xg for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Nuclear pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of Covaris Non-ionic Shearing Buffer and spun at 1,700xg for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of Covaris Non-ionic Shearing Buffer. Two 20 ul aliquots of the resuspended pellets were removed prior to shearing to be used as subsequent unsheared controls for immunoblotting and agarose gel electrophoresis. The remaining samples were transferred to AFA tubes (TC12 x 12 mm). Samples were sheared using a Covaris S2 SonoLAB Single system for two minutes (Duty cycle: 5%; Intensity: 4; cycle: 200). Total nuclear protein concentration of each sample in mg/ml was determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).  To test shearing efficiency, a 20 ul aliquot from each sample was obtained after shearing. The aliquots from the unsheared sample and the sheared sample, were incubated with 100 ul 1X TE buffer, 10 ul 10% SDS, and RNAse A (10 ug/ul, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After adding proteinase K (2 ug), the samples were incubated overnight at 65\u00b0C. The DNA was purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator columns (Catalog #: D4013, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and ran on an E-gel EX 2% agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Target fragment sizes for chromatin immunoprecipitation were in the range of 150-700 bp in length with average fragment size of 300 bp.  Immunoprecipitaiton was performed by the manufacturer's instruction (SimpleChIP protocol #9003, Cell Signaling Technology). 'Input' sample (10 ul) was obtained prior to immunoprecipitation.  Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was performed using 30-90 ug of sheared chromatin in 500 uL of 1X Covaris Non-ionic Shearing Buffer with 10 \u03bcl anti-H3K27 acetylation antibodies. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation, followed by incubation with ChIP Grade Protein G Magnet Beads (Catalog #: 9006, Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with rotation. The beads were washed a total of four times, including three low salt washes followed by one high salt wash for 5 min each at 4\u00b0C. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted from the beads with 150 ul of 1X ChIP Elution Buffer for 30 mins at 65\u00b0C in a thermomixer. To reverse crosslinks, 6 ul of 5 M NaCl and 2 ul of 20 ug/ul  Proteinase K were added to the chromatin followed by incubation at 65\u00b0C overnight. DNA was purified according to the manufacturer's instruction.\nSequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction (NuGEN Ovation SP Ultralow library system kit). Adaptor-conjugated iibraries were amplified by PCR. The amplified libararies were measured.  A fixed amount of the total measured DNA was used for sequencing in an Illumina Hiseq2000 instrument to obtain single read data.

Before sorting, cells from both conditions were filtered (70 \u00b5m nylon mesh) and propidium iodide staining identified dead/damaged cells. Whole blood was collected from a healthy donor into EDTA tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Co). Separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was performed with Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for density gradient separation, 4 ml of blood was added onto 3 ml of Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM. Centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 minutes at 18\u00baC without brake. PBMC layer was recuperated and washed twice with PBS at 400g for 15 minutes at 18\u00baC. PBMC were resuspended in freezing solution (10% DMSO, 90% non-inactivated FBS) and frozen with gradually decreasing temperatures (1\u00baC/min) to -80\u00baC (cryopreserved). After storage for one week at -80\u00baC, the cryopreserved sample was rapidly thawed in a water bath in continuous agitation and placed into 25 ml of cold 1x HBSS. Cells were washed once in ice cold 1x HBSS and resuspended in DMEM before sorting. To avoid batch effects, fresh PBMC were sorted in parallel with the cryopreserved material and distributed over the same sequencing pools. Therefore, blood from the same donor was isolated as described above and directly resuspended in DMEM. Dead and damaged cells were identified by propidium iodide staining. Primary mouse colon was dissected from an athymic nu/nu mouse and placed on ice. The sample was divided and half of the colon was immediately prepared for single cell separation, while the other half was minced on ice, placed into freezing solution II (10% DMSO, 90% non-inactivated FBS) and frozen with gradually decreasing temperatures (1\u00baC/min) to -80\u00baC (cryopreserved). After storage for one week at -80\u00baC, the sample was rapidly thawed in a water bath in continuous agitation and placed into 25 ml of cold 1x HBSS.

Propidium iodide staining identified dead/damaged cells.\nTo construct single cell libraries from polyA-tailed RNA, we applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (MARS-Seq; Jaitin et al., Science 2014).  This methodology generates paired-end reads where read 1 contains the transcript sequence and read 2 the cell and UMI barcodes. Briefly, single cells were FACS-sorted into 384-well plates, containing lysis buffer and reverse-transcription (RT) primers. The RT primers contained the single cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for subsequent de-multiplexing and correction for amplification biases, respectively.    Full-length RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the SMARTseq2 protocol (Picelli et al., Nat Methods 2013) with minor modifications. Briefly, freshly harvested or cryopreserved (1 week at -80\u00baC) single cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing the lysis buffer. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScrpit II (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo-dT30VN, template-switching oligonucleotides and betaine. The cDNA was amplified using the KAPA Hifi Hotstart ReadyMix (Kappa Biosystems), ISPCR primer and 20 cycles of amplification. Following purification with Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckmann Coulter), product size distribution and quantity were assessed on a Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitvity DNA Kit (Agilent). 200 ng of the amplified cDNA was fragmented using Nextera\u00ae XT (Illumina) and amplified with indexed Nextera\u00ae PCR primers. Products were purified twice with Agencourt Ampure XP beads and quantified again using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitvity DNA Kit.",

All 12 ganglia were sequentially digested, first with 1 ml of 40u/ml Papain with NaHCO3 and l-cysteine at 37\u00b0C for 13 min, followed by 4mg/ml Collagenase Type 2, 4.7mg/ml Dispase Type 2 at 37 \u00b0C for another 13 min. Enzymes were Papain (Worthington #LS003126, Collagenase (Worthington, # LS004174) and Dispase (Roche 04942078001). Ganglia were washed with Tyrode\u2019s buffer (in mM: 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 10 pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.4 (318-323 mOsM) to remove enzymes and transferred into 40\u03bcl fresh Tyrode\u2019s solution. Under visual guidance on a stereomicroscope, ganglia were gently triturated 3-5 times each with a 200\u03bcm diameter and then a 140\u03bcm fire-polished glass pipet. Large debris was removed by gravity filtering the suspension through a \u224835\u03bc cell sieve (Corning 352235) into 1ml Tyrode\u2019s buffer in a 15mm cell culture well. At this stage, the suspension still included significant quantities of axon fragments and glial cells. The cell suspension was gently swirled by hand such that neurons remained concentrated at the center of the well while glial cells and axon fragments dispersed centrifugally to the periphery and could be carefuly withdrawn in 700\u03bcl. This manual separation was repeated 8-10 times with 700\u03bcl of fresh Tyrode\u2019s buffer at each iteration. Total time for ganglion dissociation and neuronal enrichment was \u224860 min. Cell viability was assessed in an aliquot of each final preparation by trypan blue exclusion on a Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). Two independent cell suspensions (on separate days) that displayed neuronal viability of 93% and 96% respectively (and 50%\u2264 viability of satellite cells \u2264 12\u03bcm in diameter) were used for subsequent steps. The suspension included \u2248 350 cells /\u03bcl in a neuron: glia ratio \u22651.5. Each cell suspension was loaded onto a primed Fluidigm C1 System (located in the University of Miami CFAR Core). Capture was on a Fluidigm integrated fluidics circuits (IFC) for large cells (\u201c17-25\u03bcm\u201d, Fluidigm 100-5761) exactly according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After completion of the run, all capture sites on the chip were examined microscopically and photographed. From a total of 192 sites on two IFCs, we rejected 68 that contained more than one cell or in which captured neurons showed blebs or membrane ruffling. Captured neurons ranged from 19-40\u03bcm in diameter.\nSynthesis of cDNA libraries and sequencing were performed at the Next-Generation Sequencing Core (NGSC) at the University of Pennsylvania. An Illumina Nextera XT DNA library preparation protocol, modified for single-cell mRNA sequencing of cDNAs acquired on the C1 system was used. Each single cell library was barcoded during synthesis, libraries were pooled (median length before fragmentation was 900bp) and single-end sequenced for a total depth of 250x10^6 reads for the pool, running on a single lane on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (High Output Mode) system. Sequence data were processed through the NGSC\u2019s standard RUM pipeline for genome alignment, junction calling, and feature quantification. Reads were mapped against mouse transcriptome (mm9) using Bowtie and genome using Bowtie and Blat and converted to Fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM) values.",

Cells were then sorted for DAPI-negative, CD34+ and CD34-negative cells using BD Influx. For the species mixing experiment, human MPL expressing Ba/F3 and UT-7 cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction, after which they were subjected to infection with CALR  variant lentiviral supernatants. Wildtype UT7 cells and mutant Ba/F3 cells were mixed in equal proportions.\nThe standard 10x Genomics Chromium v.2 protocol was carried out according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) until after emulsion breakage and recovery of first strand cDNA. If the targeted gene of interest, e.g. SF3B1, was not robustly detected by the standard 10x procedure (i.e. if <60% of the expected cells showed expression) based on a priori knowledge in a similar dataset, a gene-specific primer was spiked into 10x primer mix at 1% of the concentration of the cDNA amplification primers for the initial cDNA PCR step. Then, during the amplification step, the 10x cDNA library underwent an extra cycle of PCR beyond the manufacturer\u2019s recommended number of cycles. After cleanup with SPRIselect, a small portion of the cDNA library, 3 \u00b5L (~10% of total) was aliquoted for targeted genotyping, and the remaining cDNA underwent the standard 10x protocol. The cDNA set aside for GoT was amplified for 3 to 4 additional cycles using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPABiosystems) and 10x primer mix to provide sufficient material for the enrichment step. After clean-up, locus-specific reverse primers and the generic forward SI-PCR were used to amplify the site of interest of the cDNA template (Supplementary Table 3) using ~10 PCR cycles. The locus-specific reverse primers contain a partial Illumina read 2 handle, a stagger to increase the complexity of the library for optimal sequencing and a gene specific region to allow specific priming. The SI-PCR oligo (10x) anneals to the partial Illumina read 1 sequence at the 3\u2019 end of the molecule, preserving the cell barcode (CB) and UMI. After the initial amplification and SPRI purification to remove unincorporated primers, a second PCR was performed with a generic forward PCR primer (P5_generic) to retain the CB and UMI together with an RPI-x primer (Illumina) to complete the P7 end of the library and add a sample index. The targeted amplicon library was subsequently spiked into the remainder of the 10x library to be sequenced together on a HiSeq 2500 or sequenced separately on MiSeq with v3 chemistry (Illumina). The cycle settings were as follows: 26 cycles for read 1, 98 or 130 cycles for read 2, and 8 cycles for sample index.",
